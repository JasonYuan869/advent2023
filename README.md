# Advent of Code 2023
Challenge: use a different programming language for each day (let's see how far I get!)

## Languages Used by Day
1. Python 3 (my main Leetcode language)
2. Rust (my best language)
3. C (what I use at work @ AMD)
4. Java (my first language)
5. Scala (used in school)
6. MatLab (first time)
7. C++ (also use this at work and school)
